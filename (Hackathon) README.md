# Talentmine
An AI project for Thakaa Hackathon that would predict the sports one has most potential in, based on Anthropometric Data.
# This is only a prototype and is being continously developed, so bare with us please ^_^

Our dataset focuses on professional and people talented in the sport. Even though ones body is not a limit, but it's a good way to start.
The features we'll analyze are in centimeter and as follow (Height, Weight, Chest Girth, Arm Lengh, Leg Lengh)
Our observation/response currently would be the sport one should follow.
We're developing multiple models the would multiple sports that fit a person.
